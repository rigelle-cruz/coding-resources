# React App using Vite


### Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

### Step 2: Install Vite

Open your terminal and run the following command to install Vite globally:

```bash
npm install -g create-vite
```

### Step 3: Create a React App

Run the following command to create a new React app using Vite:

```bash
create-vite my-react-app --template react
```

Replace `my-react-app` with the desired name for your project.

### Step 4: Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd my-react-app
```

### Step 5: Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 6: Start the Development Server

Run the development server to see your React app in action:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can access your app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Step 7: Explore and Edit

Your React app is now set up! Explore the project structure and start editing the `src` directory to modify your React components.

### Step 8: Build for Production

When you're ready to deploy your app, build the project using:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will create an optimized build in the `dist` directory.

### Step 9: Serve the Production Build (Optional)

To test the production build locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run serve
```

This will serve the optimized production build on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
